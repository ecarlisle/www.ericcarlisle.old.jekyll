<p>Client-side asset management has always a tedious process - which is to say, it's a real pain in the arse! What libraries do I need? What libaries are in use? Do I have the right versions of everything? How judicious will I in managing specific asset versions? Upon using the <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> package manager for the first time, I fell in love.  Suddenly my world was filled with unicorns, double rainbows and all without the need of ellicit substances.</p>

<p>Why? Because Bower just made me an asset-management ninja!</p>


<p>If you've already used tools like <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> or apt-get, then you've already used and appreciated the toolng paradigm - install, update, ininstall, all from a single terminal command.  To install Bower, you must have <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Node.js</a> installed. You can then use <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">Node Package Manager</a> to install Bower.</p>
