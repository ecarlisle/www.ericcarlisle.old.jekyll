excerpt: More and more we're seeing the grouping of the terms "User Interface" and "User Experience" into a handy abreviation, "UI/UX." This is often seen in job titles for Designers, Developers, Architects, Strategists, and other web professionals. While the discliplines for UI and UX specialties are definitely related, I feel that putting a slash between the two terms misrepresents their meanings. I feel that the slash suggests that UI and UX are synonymous and interchangable. This is definitely not the case. Instead of taking an editorial complaint approach, however, I'd like to examine the discliplines related to both terms to encourage knowledge of and appreciation of the differences. Perhaps after further ivestigation we'll decide that "UI&amp;UX" may be a better-suited abbreviation.

			More and more we're seeing the terms "User Interface" and "User Experience" grouped into a handy abreviation, "UI/UX." We see this a lot in web production job titles for designers, developers, and managers &mdash; e.g. "UI/UX Designer" or "UI/UX Developer." While UI and UX are certainly related in web production, putting a slash betweem them may distort their meanings and purposes. Specifically, the slash suggests the terms are synonymous and interchangable, which is definitely not the case. Ciriticizing choice of semantic may initially seem trivial, but let's explore both terms 

			an exploration of the interdisciplary priciples and practices of UI and UX reveals the importance .

Instead of taking an editorial complaint approach, however, I'd like to examine the discliplines related to both terms to encourage knowledge of and appreciation of the differences. Perhaps after further ivestigation we'll decide that "UI&amp;UX" may be a better-suited abbreviation.

		<p>
			Before going on I'm going to confess that I've been guilty of using this horrid slash pattern. My previous job title was "Lead UI/UX Architect." I wanted both specialties stated in my title as I've had enough experience in both to own it and advertise it. The slash pattern was also familiar and recognized, so I followed the trend without giving it much thought.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over time I became increasingly uncomfortable with the title as I often needed to explain UI and UX differences to colleagues and clients. This also happened when giving presenting as my content is often front-end focused and I'd end up making distinctions there too. Over time I decided that my job title was hypocritical and a verbal antipattern. I felt it sent the wrong message and that a stronger distinction between UI and UX was needed. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There are three important differences I considered when deciding to trash the slash.
		</p>

	<section>
		<h4 class="tmar3">1. Different Goals</h4>
		<p>
			The end result of UI effort is a product, usually a website, app, or mix thereof. A UI as a technological construct allowing for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The goal of a UI profesional is to provide a means for this interaction. Most UI professionals identify themselves as a designer, developer, or mix thereof. A UI is a careful orchestration of both creative talent and technical proficiency.
		</p>

		<p>
			The end result of a UX efforts are users behaviors attributed to creative and strategic choices made in the creation of the UI. UX implementation is often described as how a website or app "feels," but I believe that's an understatement of the UX bredth. The goal of a UX professional is to achieve certain user behavior, but that's accomplished by becoming an avdocate of the user. A UX professional will study the user, learn their needs, extend them empathy, and test them relentlessly. All of these efforts are carefully aligned with streategic business goals.
		</p>

		<p>
			In a Twitter conversation with <a href="http://davehogue.com/">Dave Hogue</a>, a UX Design Manager at Google, he drew the goal distinction with the following metaphor:
		</p>

		<div class="tweet flex flex-row space-around">

			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/eric_carlisle">@eric_carlisle</a> Definitely NOT the same. It&#39;s the difference between &quot;steering wheel&quot; and &quot;driving&quot; - one is interface, the other experience.</p>&mdash; Dave Hogue (@DaveHogue) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveHogue/status/580104237247418368">March 23, 2015</a></blockquote>


			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/eric_carlisle">@eric_carlisle</a> And that should be &quot;experience in context&quot;, because &quot;drivng&quot; is inputs, moments, decisions, emotions, reactions, etc.</p>&mdash; Dave Hogue (@DaveHogue) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveHogue/status/580104409092206592">March 23, 2015</a></blockquote>

		<h4 class="tmar3">2. Different Skills</h4>
		
		<p>
			The contributions made by UI and UX specialists are different, each requiring their own set of skills. Let's examine a sampling of some UI and UX skill sets that you'll see on projects.
		</p>

		<div class="flex flex-row space-around">
			<dl>
				<dt>UI</dt>
				<dd>UI Architectures, Frameworks, Patterns</dd>
				<dd>Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</dd>
				<dd>Software Design Patterns, Frameworks</dd>
				<dd>Search Engine Optimization (Markup)</dd>
				<dd>Performance Optimization</dd>
				<dd>Visual, Graphic &amp; Interactive Design</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>UX</dt>
				<dd>User Research, Insight</dd>
				<dd>Prototyping, User Testing</dd>
				<dd>Information Architecture</dd>
				<dd>Sketching, Wireframing</dd>
				<dd>Content Strategy &amp; Search Engine Optimization (Content)</dd>
				<dd>Visual, Graphic &amp; Interactive Design</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>

		<p>
			Yes, I did include <em>Visual, Graphic &amp; Interactive Design</em> on both. Though UI and UX Design practices aren't interchangable, there is overlap between the two specialties. Web and app design practices tend to be present in both UI and UX.
		</p>

		<h4 class="tmar3">3. Different Education</h4>

		<p>
			While you might not find UI- or UX-specific major at your University, there are courses and concentrations that are a better match for each specialty.
		</p>

		<p>
			It probably comes as no surprise that UI Development &amp; Architecture careers are strengthened by a Computer Science education. Similarly, Visual or other Liberal Arts educations are good backgrounds for Design roles, both in UI and UX. Those are admittedly huge generalizations, but I'd like instead take a detailed approach to potential aspects of a UX-strong education. Let's consider the following academic areas as contributors.
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dd>
				<strong>Industrial Design &amp; Product Design:</strong>
				These design processes contribute to creative aspects of Human-Computer Interaction. These concepts greatly aid experience design and analysis.
			</dd>
			<dd>
				<strong>Cognitive &amp; Applied Pyschology</strong>
				Insight into cognitive processes such as problem solving, memory, attention, learning, and perception helps in ... understanding of users as well as reseach practices.

				provide insight that can drive you towards your UX goals. Psychology courses usually also help to build and strengthen research skills that are very helpgul on UX projects.
			</dd> 
			<dd>
				<strong>Film &amp; Video</strong><br/>While this may not immediately seem relevent, a chief goal a of film or video production is to create an experience provoking a series of emotional or thought responses. Additionally, film and video productions are very cross-disclinary, as are web and app projects.
			</dd>
			<dd>
				<strong>Communication</strong><br/>A core purpose of websites and apps is to convey content. How we convery our messaging of the content is critical to its understanding and acceptance. Having a Communication education can contribute to skills needed for content strategy, development, and delivery.
			</dd>
			<dd>
				<strong>Cultural Studies</strong><br/>The creation of the Internet has resulted in a tremendous change to the global culture paradigm. We now have an amazing capability to communicate on a global scale. However, the recognition of cultural differences can be critical in how our communication is interpreted and accepted. Businesses going global sometimes knowingly or unknowingly make the assumption that "Our business model worked here so it will work over there too." Because of lack of adjustment made for cultural variances, the results were not always successful. 
			</dd>
		</dl>

		<hr/>

		<p class="tmar2">
			I'll close by emphasizing that my intention is not to say that UI and UX live on different planets. The two depend on one another and there is crossover between the two. If you have a UI or UX job, chances are that you probably use both in one way or another.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, we do need to be careful of thinking about the two as one and the same. Criticizing the "UI/UX" semantic may be a picky way to draw distinction, but I think it's important one. This is a common pattern that can cause misunderstanding. I now use "UI&amp;UX" and encourage others to do the same.
		</p>

			Thoughts?
