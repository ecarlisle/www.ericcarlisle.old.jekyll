  A friend and colleague of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/theericsauter">Eric Sauter</a>, recently took an interest in speaking and presenting at tech meetups and conferences. I think that's fantastic as so many good things can come from presenting, both for the audience and the speaker. His most recent opportunity was to give a lightning talk at <a href="http://conf.reactjs.com/">React.js Conf 2016</a>. This was a larger audience and his <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/esauter5/a-react-native-retrospective">presentation</a> was constructively critical to <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>. That was pretty daring, especially with the presentation title "React Native Sucks... a little bit." I thought he nailed it!

  I was tempted to further inspire Eric by offering advice for future engagements. Instead I decided to post to share what I had learned from my experiences. If you're considering presenting or have already started and want to relate, here are some general suggestions. I've learned some of them from hitting home runs and others from falling on my face. I hope this helpful and encourage you to persue presenting if it sounds appealing and you've yet to do it. 
</p>

<p>
  Let's start off with some soft skill topics. After that, we'll get more technical.
</p>

<h3>Start Small</h3>
<p>
  Hopefully somewhere closeby there's a user group in your area of interest that holds <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetups</a>. If so, chances are that the group organizer is open to if not already looking for new speakers, new content, and new ideas (we'll come back to the word "new" in just a bit). If so, this can be a perfect opportunity to get started!
</p>

<p>
  Audience sizes at meetups are typically small(er), even if the user group has a sizable membership. That tends to make the environment more casual and the audience more approachable. Think of it as just another meeting you're attending at work, only that it'll probably be a lot more fun.
</p>

<p>
Sense of community.
You feel the weight of expectations and it's easier to get feedback. You start learning what the experience feels like and can start taking notes on what you did well or improve upon.

<h3>Be Your Groovy Self</h3>
<p>
  This may initially sound trite, but maintaining natural candor on stage can be surprisingly tough. At first there might be some butterflies. I had them and sometimes still do. After all, you 

  and you're going to be determined to rise above them. 


  You've probably already been an audience for an awkward presentation and know 

  You know that you don't want to look nervous or insecure. After all, sometimes people spent a lot of time and 

  Projecting a mood

<h3>Stay Engaged</h3>

  Ask how we're doing.

<h3>Keep it Funny, But Carefully</h3>
