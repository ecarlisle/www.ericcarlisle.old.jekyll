<p>Happy Star Wars day! Let's have some fandom fun! :-)</p>

<p>
  Let's start with one of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi's</a> newest innovations, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/">The Raspberry Pi Zero</a>. Next let's encase it with a few hundred Nanoblocks in a shape befitting said Star Wars fandom. Geekery ensues!

  While this is some scifi fun and I'm showing off a bit, I send this out as a salute to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>.  The Pi Foundation inspires global educational empowerment with the creation of low-cost computer hardware. Just when I think The Pi Foundation couldn't inspire me more, they blow me away again with a $5 computer board. That's right, five dollars. With the addition of some peripherals and adapters, the Zero can be made into a human-usable computer system at an ashtonishingly low cost.
</p>

<p>
  BTW, please don't read into my choice of spacecraft as a reflection of anything Pi. I doubt that the Pi Foundation is filled with Sith Lords with ambitions for intergallactic domination.  I chose a recognizable build that didn't hide the board.
