  The type and number of characters we use for code indention have and probably will always be a source of contention for programmers. Should we use tabs or spaces and if spaces, how many? While some consider it a tired argument, I find it interesting and often comical. Is there a best practice? Does this have more to do with preference and personal efficiency? Is this a Human Factors case as well as a Computer Science one?

  This post is not for evangelizing a certain way of indention or for trolling another. Consider it a story of why I chose to indent the way I do. The topic isn't conducive to being a page-turner, so we'll keep it short and use brevity when possible.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. - College : Tabs as a Source of Beer Money</h2>
<p>
  It was the mid-nineties, I was an undergrad, and learned that HTML was lucrative. I learned by studying other people's code and used what I saw - tabs. I wasn't a CompSci major and the only other language I knew was Fortran 77 ("Whaaaaaat?") using spaces. What, there was another way to indent?
</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. - Post Y2K : I Can Still Use Tabs, Right?</h2>
<p>
  Though the college plan was Sound Recording, I gravitated to a web career. I learned other languages, how to work with data, and things got generally more complicated. I also started seeing more space-indented code. Huh? Why use multiple characters when I could KISS with 1 character? I hadn't yet discovered (or thought to seek out) <span class="strike">editors</span> IDEs that auto-indented using spaces, so this was nuts! I resisted and sallied forth with tabs! 
</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. - The Aughts : Kneel Before <span class="strike">Zod</span> Space!</h2>
<p>
  Ok, it's sounding like I'm trolling spaces now, but bear with me. As I worked with larger teams, source control, and distributed projects, *poof* spaces seemed to be the thing. At least, that was my perception. I used what my team used and tried to tweak editors to keep things looking readable. That being said, I chose a new preference.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. - Present Day : TabMan becomes TwoSpace!</h2>
<p>
  I currently indent with two-spaces whenever I can. It's a preference because that works better for. My rationale is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I still <em>want</em> to use less characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shallow indention is generally more readable <em>for me</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    It's easier <em>for me</em> to tell if the number of indents suggests refactoring needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>I</em> can better eyeball where I open and close code. I know editors help with this, but I don't like depending on that.
  </li>
  <li>
    Diffs are easier <em>for me</em> to review in GitHub, BitBucket, Stash.
  </li>
  <li>
    Editors like Sublime Text can make two spaces feel tab-ish.
  </li>
</ul>
<a name="footnote1" style="font-size: 11px"><em>1. I like bigger indents with Python.</em></a>

<h2>Chapter 5. : Will Chewie Ever Get His Medal?</h2>

<p>
  Do I still want to use a single character to indent?  Yes I do, but there's also the need to abide by different project styling requirements. I would love it if:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    My editor indented with tabs that were displayed like two-space depth.</li>
  <li>
    I could configure my editor to save files that saved these "short-tabs" as 2-spaces, 4-spaces, or whatever the project required.
  </li>
  <li>
    I could reopen said code and still use groovy short-tabs.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If someone should speak out in the comments to say <em>"There are 10 editors that do EXACTLY that! What rock have you been living under?"</em>, please do so! You'd be my hero!</p>

<p>
  Bottom line - my choice of indentation is a combination of personal preference, what I feel makes me more productive, and the most manageable fit with existing standards. Do you feel another way? I dig that! Happy coding!
