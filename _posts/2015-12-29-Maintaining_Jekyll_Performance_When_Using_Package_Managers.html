<p>
  When getting started with a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">Jekyll</a> site, it's very important to learn about its <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">directory structure</a> and how that works with the Jekyll generator. Most of this is very intuitative and you'll be quickly learning where to place templates, partials, posts, and general content pages. 
</p>

<p>
  You'll notice all the initial folders and the site configuration file begin with an underscore.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
.
├── _config.yml
├── _drafts
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── _data
├── _site
└── index.html
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  These folders are essentially plumbing that Jekyll needs to generate the site. When adding new files and folders, however, the underscore convention is very important. By naming a resource with a preceding underscore, you're telling Jekyll to exclude that file or folder from the site's build process.
</p>

<p>
  Let's add a few new resources to this site: 
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
.
├── _projects.html
├── contact.html
├── _images
└── scripts
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  On the next Jekyll build, the generator will ignore the <em>projects.html</em> file and <em>images</em> directory. The remaining items will be processed and placed into the <em>_site</em>, the default Jekyll destination directory.  
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
.
├── _projects.html
├── contact.html
├── _images
├── _site
|   ├── scripts
|   └── contact.html
└── scripts
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Pretty straight forward, right? A straight-forward convention that's easy to remember. What could possibly go wrong?
</p>

<p>
  One day I started noticing that my Jekyll builds were taking upwards of 2-3 minutes.  This is a tremendous lag compared to the subsecond build time I'd become accustomed to. After much Googling and some hair-pulling, I found the culprits.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
.
├── bower_components
└── node_modules
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  I'd recently started using NPM and Bower for that site. By not having the underscore on the package download folders, I was asking Jekyll to include an unneeded 12,000+ files in each build. Ouch!
</p>

<p>
  The workaround for this is very easy and there were a couple of choices. If you're using Bower, you can customize it's download directory by making a <em>.bowerrc</em> file. 
</p>

{% highlight json %}
{
  "directory": "_bower_components/"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Node doesn't allow customization of the <em>node_modules</em> directory but we can alternately exclude via <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/">_config.yml</a>, Jekyll's site configuration file.
</p>

{% highlight yaml %}
exclude:
  - bower_components
  - node_modules
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The exclude option is very handy, especially when you can't or don't want to deal with underscores.
</p>

{% highlight yaml %}
exclude:
  - bower_components
  - bower.json
  - CNAME
  - gulpfile.js
  - node_modules
  - license.md
  - package.json
  - README.md
  - npm-debug.log
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  After making those changes, I was back to seeing the heart-warming subsecond build times again. Yay!
