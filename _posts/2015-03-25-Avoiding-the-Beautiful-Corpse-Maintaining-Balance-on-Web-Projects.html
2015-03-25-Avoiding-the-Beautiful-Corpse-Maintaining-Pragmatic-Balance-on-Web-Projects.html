<p>A colleague reached out to me recently after reading one of my slidedecks on <a href="" target="_new">Responsive Design with Bootstrap</a>. In the presentation, I cover some  development approaches and project management methodologies. While he appreciated these ideas, he raised a concern that 


his asked

it's hard for these best practices to be understood and appreciated by a customer. Not only did he want to sell the devilerable, but the process that led to its success.</p>

<p>Part of his concern was one that's pretty common to all web site or application projects. Customers want to be closely involved with decision-making processes to ensure that their goals are met or exceeded. However, they are usually far removed from most technical aspects of web production and are incapable from contribute to thoser parts of the project. Now you may ask:

<blockquote>
	"Why should they be involved in every stage of web production? After all, they have hired experts to provide a service that they cannot tackle themselves."
</blockquote>

<p>An answer is that without some exposure to web production process, the customer can overcompensate and overcontribute to the parts of the process they can more easily grasp. As a result, other stages of the project suffer by having a smaller portion of the finite project resources.</p>

<p>This can easily happen during the design stage of a project - graphic, interactice, content, and user experience. I want to emphasize that I'm not picking on designers. Well executed strategy on content, design, and experience are critical to the success of a project. The project fails without it. However, this is often where the customer has the most opportunity to communicate their a vision and the ideas and opinions that compose it. This is a good thing. We are, after all, advocates of the customer's vision and any insight we get is great!</p>

<p>The rub is that keeping control of this stage can be very tricky. Discovery is made and design iteration begins. Feedback is exchanged and design iteratively approaches the customer's goal. It is critical, though, that the scope of this stage is carefully managed. This is the stage the customer may most relate to and it's very easy at this point for a project to spin out of control. Matt Inman illustrated this beautifully in <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell">How a Web Design Goes Straight to Hell</a>. I've witnessed many projects where time and resources spent on the design stage exhausted the project budget. What then follows is an awkward stage where it's decided who is going to take the hit for the project to continue.</p>

<p>What remains is a race to the finish with development, data, QA/QC, and any other production stage. It's not unusual at this point for these stages to be rushed and quality of that work compromised. My colleague described the result as the "beautiful corpse" for which form overcame function and the final product was ultimately a failure.</p>

<p>While overemphasis on design isn't uncommon, it's not the only stage that can unbalance the project. I've also witnessed overengineered projects where function shadowed form resulting in a potentially powerful tool that was inusable.</p>

<p>So how do we solve this problem? </p>


<h3>1. Sell the Product AND the Process</h3>
<p>my colleagues desire was not only a good marketing practice to express positive differentiation, but also reflected a best practice for project execution.</p>


<h3>2. Encourage Trust</h3>


<li>The customer must be validated, but boundaries must be set. I've often said "The customer is always right, but..." which I believe is fair.</li>
<li>the production team can't have silos. Everyone on a production team is a problem solver.</li>
<li>Be as picky as you can afford to be with your clients</li>
<li>Make them a part of the entire web production process, if only be providing more exposure.</li>
</ol>

As the UI, UX, and designer guy, believe it or not, I feel your pain.  I focus on UI & UX, but have always been a full stack guy.  I've been on the business logic and data tiers when the customer was blowing the entire project budget with designers.  Shit would then roll downhill and it was crazy trying to put together an application that wasn't shit.

It's hard to know exactly how to solve the problem.  The UI and design is the only thing the customer usually can relate with and for that reason, they usually want to overcompensate.  If you've not seen this Oatmeal, I think it tells the story pretty well.  It's placed in the role of a web designer, but I think it stands true for all web production, architecture, and development:

How Web Design Goes Straight to Hell

My opinion is that a lot of responsibility falls on the sales process for a project as well as the expectations kept via a project manager.  The ultimate goal is to create a product that effectively engages a user in content/data, often to solve a problem or overcome a goal.  The customer needs to have input and feel validated for that, but it's the job of a project manager to let experts be experts, to facilitate trust of the project team.  After all, every member of a web team is a problem solver.  

A good project has assume a paradigm may initially sound paradoxical.  It has to keep everyone on a close-knit, silo-free workflow while using the strengths of each specialist.  A designer should be a great designer but have insight into the world of an engineer.  A content strategist must be good at information architecture, but it helps to be mindful of how this content is managed on the data side.  This sounds idealistic, but it's something we have to figure out due to the technical paradigms we have to work with now.  Everything is knit so much closer.  Multitiered architecture exists both on the server and client sides, what used to be a single request/response model where silos were more forgivable.  

I've been working with tools like React, Angular, and ClojureScript.  I have to be an engineer, and artist, and an advocate of the user.  I also need to advocate creativity and innovation while at the same time maintaining focus and pragmatism.  As you can imagine, that careful balance is very, very challenging!  I strain my intellect every day  just to stay caught up and remain and competitive.

BTW, I was recently on a project recently that was the opposite of the beautiful corpse.  Everything was sacrificed for an over-idealist, self-indulgent architecture and as a result the UI and UX was shit.  I guess you could call it something like the "mute-orator"... nah, need to think of something better.

Anyway, I'll send this out.  Thanks again for the idea!  I hope that you and the family are well.  If you have time, can you send me pictures.  We'll have to compare notes on be a Dad.  Holy shit, new world order! :-D
