<p>File this one under "Why not?" :-)</p>

<p>
  Let's start with one of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi's</a> newest innovations, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/">The Raspberry Pi Zero</a>. Next we'll wrap a few hundred nanoblocks around this brilliant computer and shape it with some Star Wars fandom. Geekery ensues!

  I send this out as a salute to an organization that's inspiring global educational empowerment with the creation of extremely low-cost computer hardware. Just when I think The Raspberry Pi Foundation couldn't inspire me more, they blow me away again! The Raspberry Pi Zero is a $5 computer board. With the addition of some peripherals and adapters the Zero can be made into a human-usable computer system at an ashtonishingly low cost.
