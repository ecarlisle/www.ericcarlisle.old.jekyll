  One day some electrons went awry at my home and I found myself in need of an electrician. I started hunting through Google, Yelp, and other geeky hunting grounds. After perusing a handful of sites and weighing my options, one other site caught my eye.
</p>

<p>
  What drew my attention wasn't anything aesthetic.  It was plain, filled with stock images, and wasn't winning any beauty contests. I grinned at the hero banner background, a photo of a lightning storm.  While scientifically relevent, it probably wasn't the best choice for a service where safety is a major factor. :-)

<p>
  Despite the aesthetics, the site's content strategy was the part of the experience that peaked my interest. This was a one-page site. Included in the site header in a big 48px font was the company's phone number. Under the electrifying hero banner were 8 paragraphs stating "here's what we offer, why we're legit, and when we're open."
</p>

<p>
  While his might not initially seem too compelling, let's consider the site's content strategy as a match for prospective customers. Electrical issues often require quick attention and in seeking a solution, content brevity is a plus. No mission statements or events calendars are required. This is what I need and have patience for little more!
</p>

<p>
  This is also a good match for those that need a service instead of a fix. Electrical services are specialized, often require licensing, and usually aren't DIY endeavors. Sometimes "Ah, you offer what I need!" is enough to get things started.
</p>

<p>
  Keep "getting things started" in mind. We'll come back to this.
</p>

<p>
  Before that, I can't say enough about a clearly-presented phone number. It's amazing how many service-oriented businesses, especially smaller ones, make users hunt for their digits. For larger companies doing so is often by design, is a cost-saving device, and I get that. For smaller companies, though, that's Information Architecture deserving some additional thought.
</p>

<p>
  This story ends with me calling this company. Someone answering within four rings. Win #1! The person was very courteous and I got a same-day appointment. Win #2! The electrician arrived, rocked the issue, and did so as per the initial estimate. Homerun! Off I went to sing praises on Yelp!
</p>

<p>
  At this point "getting things started" turned into a very happy "got it done." My problem was fixed and the company now has a new loyal customer. It's important to notice, however, that the web site didn't make the sell. 4307 Walther Ave. Baltimore, MD 21214
