  So I've been doing this web thing for about 20 years now. Aside from being my professional livelihood, it's also my passion. I've worked on countless pet projects, spoken at several conferences, have been a mentor to many, and am always dreaming of the next cool project. That being said, I'm not blogging any of this. What's up with that?
</p>

<p>
  There's no law saying I have to blog, but I really want to. I feel strongy about the sharing of knowledge, passing forth experiences, and just geeking out with other folks that share my passions. Each time, however, the desire to blog just doesn't materialize. Instead, it fizzles. The result is a "Recent Posts" header followed by a single article written two years ago. There's no follow up and that single article eventually becomes stale and embarrasing to have on a web site.

  I've given a lot of though of why this keeps happening and am using that hindsight for a new blogging strategy. In doing so I'm also taking a lot of advice from successful bloggers that have faced the same challenges.
</p>

<p>
  So, here's my plan:
</p>

<h3>#1 - Don't Write Dissertations.</h3>
<p>
  We all want to have good blog content that's informative, has (verifyably) correct content, and reads well.  Otherwise we're misinforming, losing credibility, and wasting time.

  Drafts folder

  Interrrogative. 


   be potentially be wasting peoples' time and risking our own credibility. To prevent this we can research our ideas, vet our alleged facts, write several drafts, and never get around to publishing the article.

</ul>

<h3>#2 - Remember that you may not get everything right the first time.</h3>
