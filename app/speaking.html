        My father was an educator and like him, education is a passion for me. In having the opportunity to speak and present, my hope is to empower others to seek, discover, and strengthen their own passions. I also benefit by meeting brilliant people, learning from them, and being inspired by their experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are a handful of presentations I've given over the past few years. Most of them are coupled with a code repository and some a video recording. I hope these are helpful in your professional pursuits and passions. Enjoy and feel free to submit any feedback!
      </p>
      <p>
        Also feel free to reach out if you'd like me to present for a meetup, conference, or classroom. I'm always happy to offer my experiences to educate and inspire.

        Responsive Design - Planning, Execution, Management
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ever find yourself thinking "I need a Responsive Design ramp-up!" or "What's up with all the Bootstrap chatter?" In only the past few years, Responsive Design has completely transformed the UI production landscape. Mobile market demand has made the move to Responsive a necessity. While going Responsive presents incredible opportunity, it also introduces formidable challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Responsive UI paradigm challenges conventional methods of planning, production, and project management. It demands change to keep us efficient and competitive. So why use Bootstrap? It’s easy to learn, easy to use, and comes loaded with ready-to-use UI components. It’s very powerful, extremely customizable, and doesn’t incur a lot of architectural commitment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This session serves two purposes. You will be introduced to building Bootstrap sites, learning to create and configure robust Responsive grid-layouts to match your browser and device requirements. We’ll also use Bootstrap components that integrate seamlessly into your grid layout. Additionally, we’ll discuss the challenges that come with Responsive Design and how to mitigate them. Topics will include mobile-first content, progressive enhancement, performance optimization, Agile workflows, and complementary tooling.

        Ridiculously Easy Layouts with Flexbox
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ready to have your mind blown? Meet Flexbox! The Flexbox (or Flexible Box) Layout Model is a set of CSS attributes that will likely change the way you think about UI layouts. Flexbox uses a dual-axis, container/item layout model allowing for powerful approaches to element space distribution, alignment, and sizing. This can be a tremendous boon for web projects with dynamic data and design flux. It may also tremendously simplify responsive layouts that are dependent on commonly complicated grid models.
      </p>
        This presentation will introduce the mechanics of the Flexible Box Model and demonstrate its capability for simplifying markup and styling. Comparisons will be made to other layout paradigms to illustrate strengths of the model.

        Dazzling Data Depiction with D3.JS
      </h2>

      <p>
        Creating data visualizations for a web has historically been a daunting task. Due to a lacking standards of browser-supported visualization, often the most approachable solutions would involve proprietary platforms, 3rd-party services, browser plugins, or just static imagery.
      </p>

      <p>
        The D3.js JavaScript library uses HTML, CSS, and SVG for binding data to web documents. This standards-based approach allows visualizations to be created across browsers without the need for 3rd-party tooling.
      </p>

      <p>
        This session will introduce the basics of D3.js and step through the process of building data-bound visualizations. Examples will include building visualizations with SVG or the HTML DOM.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attendees should have a basic understanding of modern Web fundamentals including HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript.

        The Yin and Yang of Responsive Web Design
      </h2>
      <p>
        Responsive design has revolutionized the way we create websites, yet there is a strong tendancy to still use traditional workflow methodologies. Such workflows can make a project far less efficient while adding a gamut of risks. This session will explore this dilemma, propose alternate workflows for responsive website projects, and offer respective approaches and tooling options for both designers and developers.
