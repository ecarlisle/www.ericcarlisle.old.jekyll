      <p>
        As a UI Developer and UX Designer, my passion is for building the user-facing web and the experiences that make it engaging, compelling, and useful. My core approach is to <em>Keep It Stunningly Simple</em>, a practice encouraging creative innovation while maintaining pragmatic focus. Via this careful balance, outstanding solutions can be created with highest probability of project success.

        Over the past 20 years I've worked in almost every aspect of web production. Much of his time has been focused on consulting, working in such market verticals as ecommerce, cybersecurity, automotive, sports entertainment, higher education, healthcare, real estate, financial, and nonprofit. I've worked with such companies as:
